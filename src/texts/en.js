  The graph shows the demand for digital competence in a select organization and different national averages over the same period. The foundation consists of a study where we used NLP as a method to analyze all Swedish job-posts during 2006-2020 through an open dataset from the National Employment agency. For additional information on the study, see https://www.digitalforvaltning.se/rapport/den-stora-vagen-av-digital-kompetens/
 
Through utilizing a EU-framework for digital competence we have analyzed the intensity of digital competence in each individual job-post. The graph is intended to be used as a data-based prerequisite for strategic dialogue on which level of digital competence an organization has recruited, and which level is the right one. Our ambition is to through this increase the capabilities for purposive digitalization of the public sector. `,
